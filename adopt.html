     <h1>Passive Adoption</h1>
     <p>This is a way of adoption where you'll be adopting any animal in shelter and be a parent. 
        You will need to pay a minimum amount on a monthly basis, and we will look after them in the 
        shelter. These are those animals which cannot be sent to homes due to the nature of their
         ailment or disability which needs constant medical attention.
    </p>
